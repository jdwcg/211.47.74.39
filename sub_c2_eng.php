                                  <h3 style="word-break: break-all;">Each course is composed of ten sections, and each lecture is subdivided into six videos,
                                    each twelve minutes long. Furthermore, ten lectures totaling 120 hours will be produced each year.
                                    Excluding the videos, 180 hours of academic volume will be arranged, encouraging those who participate in the lecture to review the material,
                                    and engage in self-study. A total of 300 hours of academic time will be prepared.
                                    During the twelve minute lecture, the lecture attendees will be provided with an introduction and further reading material covering music, pictures,
                                    food preparation for ancestor ceremonies, cyber temple visits, and production of holy objects, all of which can be accessed via the 180 hours of self-study material.
                                    In addition, an online meeting section will be added, affording those who attended the video lectures an opportunity to present a thesis in an international academic conference.

Next, through the usage of Spanish, we will focus on Latin America. The decision for the distribution of regions was based upon a consideration of the attributes of the university, the home countries of the international students attending the university, as well as the international universities that partner with our research center. While within the European continent, Germany and France are home to the origin of Korean Studies, this region has more interest in philosophy than religion. Therefore it was the decision of this institute to place more of a focus on Latin America, which is more oriented towards religion. In the case of China, as there are 310 courses in Korean studies, and 19 universities offering degrees in Korean Studies, this area possesses a large possibility for development. Classes tailored to each region are: 5) Confucianism in texts and rituals (customized for Chinese regions), 6) Religious Protestantism of the Revival of the Church (customized for American regions), 7) Korean Catholicism: Praying with Mother Mary (customized for Latin regions), and 10) Smart City of K Religion (customized to urban areas).

                                    <h3 style="word-break: break-all;">Confucianism, Christianity, and Catholicism, accounting for 40% of these, are regionally tailored lectures taking in to consideration the respective regions of China, the United States, and Latin America. The institute's independent regional setting is a course that changes the perspective of a city as an inner region that separates the city from the rural and mountainous areas. This will explain the changes arising all over the world between the urban and rural areas. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to uncover the religious dynamics that are changing, not only from regional separation within Korea, but also from the global phenomenon of urbanization.

                                    <h3 style="word-break: break-all;">All K-religion lectures are composite studies that encompass culture and art, and include specific  practices, and cultural and artistic achievements currently practiced in Korean religions. These lectures will not only demonstrate Korean attributes, but will possess a versatile application, which can be applied worldwide. In relation to the international region characteristics, we have selected: (Latin America) Catholicism’s Holy Mother Mary, (North America) Revival of Religion: Protestantism, (China) Confucianism: A Religion of Text and Rites, and “Smart City’s K-Religion,” for urban and rural areas. Furthermore, as separate religions, we have added Shamanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Protestantism, Catholicism, and New Religious Movements. We will place strong emphasis on the rites and culture of these religions, as well as religious culture based on common elements such as food and city environment.
