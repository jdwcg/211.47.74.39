On the basis of the results of the academic conference, a worked entitled, “The Holy Matters and Activities of Korean Religions,” will be produced in 2026. The Korean version will be published separately. The power point and subtitles used in the video lectures will be used as the lecture material in making the data. The table of contents and the title of the sourcebook will be the same as the &lt;supplemental material list&gt; referenced in the lectures. Publication will be a composition of the third and fifth year’s research, and the English version will be published as a print and e-book version, via the cooperation of an international academic publishing company. The Korean version will also be published in accordance with the same criteria, but will be done by a domestic publishing company.

                                    <h3 style="word-break: break-all;">The Korean research plan will cover the religious cultural products and rites, that are the center piece of this lecture. The direction of the writing will establish the diverse and independent nature of K-Religion, which is reconstructed and signified through cultural products and rites. The English research plan places its goal in spreading the success of Korean Religions’ Culture and domestic religious research to the international community. While the video lectures form the base of the course content, they are not simply translated from Korean; they are written in English from the start. Our research center, through our expert translators and supervisors, will be able to raise the quality of the English translations.

                                  <h3 style="word-break: break-all;">The documentary is the creative plan of our research. The title, “The Attractions of K-Religions,” will be produced in two parts, with the first in the 3rd year, and the second in the 5th year. The documentary will be submitted to a movie festival. Prior to the submission of the documentary, we will hold a preview, and invite the members of the Research Performance Sharing Council. These achievements will be closely coordinated with selected institutions. Documentary Production Plan: The documentary production plan is supervised by a video expert, an internationally renowned documentary producer who participated in this study, and collaborated with an internationally renowned foreign director. The documentary will be planned, produced, and disseminated first, from the prospective of emphasizing Korean Religion, and second, from a perspective of alternating between Korean and European religions. Documentary Distribution: The distribution of the documentary will be overseen by a specially selected impact producer, who will be tasked with raising the proliferation of the documentary through providing it to movie festivals, as well as universities, libraries, and other educational institutions. We will host three international academic conferences. In the first year we will promote the establishment of the research center, as well as research participation with the international community. In the third year, we will invite international academics already residing in Korea, and provide them with an opportunity to personally come, and spread K-Religion. In the 5th and final year, we will host the third international academic conference, and provide the lecture attendees with the opportunity to present on their own individual research findings. In addition, a day for student presentations will be allotted for. This will allow not only academics, but students who have attended the lectures, and have participated via the videos and the application, a chance to present. In addition, we want to allow for a more advanced video conference round by inviting student organizations or lecture clubs, rather than individual students, made through the functions provided by the application. At this time, the lecturer of the course will meet face to face with the students, and an advance dialogue will take place. International University Research Center : Our research center has partnered with University of Malaga, located in Spain, British Columbia University’s Center for Korean Studies, and MOU, and will strive to provide Korean academia. Furthermore, we also have formed a close network, with various Korean Studies institutes within Europe and North America.
